## Key Steps :

Set up VPC named bonAppetite with public and private subnets, assign the ip addresses. Create the security group , open the ports HTTP, SSH and MongoDB(port no: 27017). Set up three EC2 instances named Mongo1 , Mongo2, Mongo3 of Ubuntu AMI, and connect it with the VPC created and the assign it to the security group made. Allocate three elastic ips and associate each with each of the three instances created, thus exposing the public ips.

Added the MongoDB Repository

Installed the MongoDB package

Configured MongoDB to operate in replica set mode, as well as allow remote access to the server


AWS components that are deployed and configured as part of this reference deployment:

A VPC configured with public and private subnets.
In the public subnets, NAT gateways to allow outbound Internet connectivity for resources (MongoDB instances) in the private subnets.
In the public subnets, bastion hosts with Elastic IP addresses to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access.
Security groups to enable communication within the VPC and to restrict access to only necessary protocols and ports.
In the private subnets, a customizable MongoDB cluster with the option of running standalone or in replica sets .
