## Steps to launch an application an AWS:

- Create Application Load Balancer on AWS with the same Security group as that of Mongodb cluster.
- Create Dockerfile to build Docker image of the application.
- Create a cluster on ECS with appropriate Key Pair and VPC with any of the two public subnets.
- Create a Repository with the name <node-app> on AWS Container Service using the Load Balancer created in the Step 1.
- Retrieve the Docker login command to authenticate Docker client to registry on AWS CLI.
- Run the Docker login command that was returned in the previous step.
- Build the Docker image using following command:
docker build -t node-app .
- Check if the image is created successfully:
	docker images 
- Tag the image in order to push to the repository:
docker tag node-app:latest 617487773334.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/node-app:latest
- Push the image to the repository on AWS:
docker push 617487773334.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/node-app:latest
- Run the image on Docker using the following command:
docker run -d 617487773334.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/node-app:latest
- Verify if the container is up and running on Docker:
docker ps â€“a
- Create Task Definition by adding a container with the image in the repository and host port and container port set to 3000.
- Create a Service in Cluster with appropriate Task Definition, Target Group, conatiner and port.
- Finally check the ECS instance and running in EC2 Dashboard and verify by accessing a ping API using Public IP of Container Instance.
