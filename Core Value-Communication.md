# Communication

Extreme Programming(XP) acknowledged Communication as one of the important core values because of the role it plays in the 
Project success.The more we communicate, the clearer we can see exactly what needs to be done, and also gain more confidence 
about what really need not be done. This helps the team to come to an agreement on any of the important decisions we may make.

A proper communication is very much needed for a successful completion of a project. As a team, we plan to meet once or twice 
a week depending on the work load set for that particular week. The main aim of these meetings is to discuss the ongoing 
activities and hindrances if any that are affecting the project progress. This will enable the team members to exchange ideas 
and discuss the project effectively. We plan to maintain and carry out the clear communication through out the project till the product is successfully launched without any issues.

The communication among team members is very effective in the second week. This is evident from the fact that the team met 
twice this week to establish a common agreement about what needs to be included and what is not. There has been a very good 
cooperation internally during the time of assigning tasks. Everyone responded in a positive manner so that all others are 
benefitted. And everyone has been vocal about their opinions too, which thereby helped the team to formulate the requirements 
in the best way possible.

On a positive note, the team members continued to maintain effective communication in the third week as well. They have been exchanging individual updates from time to time throughout the week. Upon the decision made about the database selection that 3 people will do on Riak and the other two will do on MongoDB, each sub group working on same database met once, before the whole team met for weekly meetings, And the team members have collaboratively decided to learn and experiment with their respective databases this week.

The fourth week has gone with all the technical discussios among the team members. There is a mutual help within the team related to the technical aspects and this can be considered a positie sign of team's unity. Members were vocal about the areas/issues they are facing with respect to the project and mutual help was derived out of it. With the actual implementaion of the project getting started next week, I expect the similar levels of communication to be exhibited in the upcoming weeks as well.

With the right set of mind and with some positive vibes the team entered fifth week of the project and the communication is happening within the team as it should be. All the members have started their individual work while also helping each other in case of blockers or issues. The team has planned only once in the week as all the members were busy working towards their goals of the project. The one meeting has been effective to keep the group in sync and keep the project rolling.

The team managed to meet once this week. And all the team members have given proper illustration about their work into the project. Communication is proper and is upto the expectation. As the load is getting heavier from week to week,the team is diligently working on the project.Although everybody is busy with their assigned part of the project, they still maintain and make sure that every little idea is properly communicated.

The seventh week of the project has witnessed the team spirit of Pied Pipers. The team members have helped each other in creating a MongoDB replica sets on eachone's individual accounts on AWS. This is one of the essential qualities expected from the team at the point of time, considering the project is in third week of the implementation. Much appreciate the team efforts. Looking forward to the last and final week of the project'.

In the last week of the project, the team has showcased extreme communication skills. Each team member helped each other in deploying the app on AWS using container service. The overall perfromance of the team during the course of the project is satisfactory. With the extraordinary skills in and out of the meetings and mutual help, the team managed to pull off the project efficiently and effectively.
