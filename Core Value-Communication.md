Extreme Programming(XP) acknowledged Communication as one of the important core values because of the role it plays in the 
Project success.The more we communicate, the clearer we can see exactly what needs to be done, and also gain more confidence 
about what really need not be done. This helps the team to come to an agreement on any of the important decisions we may make.

A proper communication is very much needed for a successful completion of a project. As a team, we plan to meet once or twice 
a week depending on the work load set for that particular week. The main aim of these meetings is to discuss the ongoing 
activities and hindrances if any that are affecting the project progress. This will enable the team members to exchange ideas 
and discuss the project effectively. We plan to maintain and carry out the clear communication through out the project till the
product is successfully launched without any issues.

The communication among team members is very effective in the second week. This is evident from the fact that the team met 
twice this week to establish a common agreement about what needs to be included and what is not. There has been a very good 
cooperation internally during the time of assigning tasks. Everyone responded in a positive manner so that all others are 
benefitted. And everyone has been vocal about their opinions too, which thereby helped the team to formulate the requirements 
in the best way possible.
