It depicts one of the most crucial core values of our project "Bon appétit".Infact, it should be the core value for each individual project in respect of which we show consideration to each other's work.

In our team, we as responsible and respectful members recognise each other's differences and try to co-operate with each other.We have also researched and have decided to scoop more information on understanding the customer requirements so that we go out of our comfort zone to meet those keeping in mind the respect for the customers as well.Also, we need to earn respect for ourselves in a team and to do that we follow some basic principles as listed below:

### 1. Give to receive

The most important step that we take to earn respect is to sincerely give it as we believe people will tend to mirror our willingness to consider their points of view and to do so with an open mind.

### 2. Be patient

If we hope that other people will spontaneously recognize our contributions and perspective, we may have to wait for a long time, which can be frustrating. We generally avoid this frustration by not acting on it and waiting patiently.

### 3. Speak up(at the right time)

Choosing the right time to express a concern or opinion can be challenging, because all of us have busy schedules. But developing a good sense of timing can make the difference in whether or not our thoughts are heard.The worst thing we could have done is become apathetic and not speak up. This will have the opposite effect of earning respect.So we try always to keep our point but at the right time.

In addition to the above listed principles, we as a team follow some other rules as well to maintain integrity in the team and to show mutual respect towards each other and towards the customers which are as follows:

### 4. Ask the right questions

We will know we are asking the right question if it spurs collaboration and ingenuity toward our given aim. We will know we have asked the wrong one if it leads to defensiveness or blame. So we try to avoid such situations.

### 5. Listen closely to everyone

We give this principle the utmost importance. We listen patiently to the observations and opinions of others and let them penetrate. We never talk down to anyone as everyone has a role to play and innovations can come from people at every level and every position. So, we maintain mutual respect for each others' opinions.

### 6. Don't take things personally

It's frustrating if we give our opinion and it's overheard or not appreciated. But our goal in sharing isn’t necessarily to have people follow our way of thinking. It’s to speak truthfully and tactfully, with the constant goal of bettering the organization and the lives of the people you serve, which brings us to our last point. So, we listen to each others' ideas properly and then decide with mutual consent on each decision to be taken with majority.

As we are in the third week of the project, we have implemented all the above points to maintain respect for each other in our team. Also we have come across some other things with the time passing that we keep in mind to maintain the peaceful environment of our team which are as follows:

### 7. We treat people with courtesy, politeness, and kindness.

### 8. Encourage team members to express opinions and ideas.

### 9. Listen to what others have to say before expressing your viewpoint. Never speak over, butt in, or cut off another person.

### 10. Use people’s ideas to change or improve work. Let employees know you used their idea, or, better yet, encourage the person with the idea to implement the idea.

### 11. Never insult people, name call, disparage or put down people or their ideas.
